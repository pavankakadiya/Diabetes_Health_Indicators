# Diabetes_Health_Indicators

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting diabetes using various algorithms. The project explores three different models:

* **Linear Regression:** A basic regression model is used to establish a baseline for prediction. Although linear regression isn't typically the best choice for classification problems, it provides a starting point for comparison.
* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** This non-parametric method is employed for classification, where the prediction for a new data point is based on the majority class among its nearest neighbors in the training data. The number of neighbors (k) is a crucial parameter that influences the model's performance.
* **Random Forest:** This ensemble learning method is known for its accuracy and robustness. It combines multiple decision trees to create a more powerful predictive model. Random Forest is particularly useful for complex datasets with a large number of features.

**Dataset:**

The project utilizes the "Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset," which contains various health-related features and a target variable indicating the presence or absence of diabetes. 

**Project Workflow:**

1. **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset is loaded, cleaned, and prepared for model training. This may involve handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.
2. **Model Training:** Each model is trained using the training portion of the dataset. Hyperparameters may be tuned to optimize the model's performance.
3. **Model Evaluation:** The trained models are evaluated on a separate testing dataset to assess their accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics. Confusion matrices and classification reports are generated for detailed analysis.
4. **Model Comparison:** The performance of the three models is compared based on the evaluation metrics. The best-performing model is identified for diabetes prediction.
5. **Feature Importance:** For the Random Forest model, feature importance analysis is conducted to determine the most influential features in predicting diabetes.

**Key Features:**

* Data preprocessing and exploration.
* Model training and evaluation with three different algorithms.
* Feature importance analysis (Random Forest).
* Confusion matrix visualization for each model.
* Comparison of model performances based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**How to use:**

1. Clone this repository: `https://github.com/pavankakadiya/Diabetes_Health_Indicators.git`
2. Upload the dataset "Diabetes_Health_Indicators.csv" to the Colab environment.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to execute the code. 

**Potential Improvements:**

* Explore other machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, or Gradient Boosting.
* Implement hyperparameter tuning techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV for further performance optimization.
* Investigate advanced feature engineering methods to enhance model accuracy.
* Develop a web application or API to deploy the trained model for real-world use.

This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of different machine learning approaches for diabetes prediction and offer insights into their performance.
